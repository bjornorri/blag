So I finished this book a while ago and I've been meaning to write a short review. I would actually love to do this for all the books I read, as I think it would be immensly satisfying to be able to look back on the year and see all the books I managed to read and maybe some highlights from each one. 
I also think it will help me to retain more of what I read and perhaps clarify for myself what the main takeaways are. 

The book is divided into two parts, the first part goes over classical patterns and explains how they can be replaced with, well, plain old functions mostly. 

Perhaps surprisingly, I learned mostly about classical OO patterns from this book. I never took a course on design patterns in university, and never worked in a job where they were widely used. I feel the book does a good job of explaining the various (seemingly very complicated) patterns commonly found in large Java/C++ projects, and their functional-style replacements.  Although in a more conventional text on design patterns, you would probably find a more thorough explanation of the benefit of the patterns. In this context they mostly feel silly and overly complex.

The second part of the book details "patterns" that are unique to functional programming. This part was not as useful, as although I've not done much FP in any serious capacity, I've been toying around with Haskell, Clojure, Erlang and other functional languages for a while. I felt that I had at least _seen_ all of these patterns before, if not realized that they were a _bona fide_ design patternâ„¢.

I'm gonna keep this short in order to have any chance of actually doing these regularly, so on that note, let's wrap up:
Overall, I enjoyed the book. It was an easy read, perhaps in part because I skimmed the latter half. Anyone that has done work in OO languages, especially Java, and is looking to start exploring Scala or Clojure will benefit from this book. It's gentle but thorough in the parts it covers, but is by no means a language reference. This book will by no means cover all of Scala/Clojure, but it will introduce enough of the languages to possibly spark some interest with the reader.

If you've read this book, or want to ask me more about it, get in touch!
