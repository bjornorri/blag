A Retrospective on 2015
-----------------------

I think it's important to occasionally take a break from the constant focus on the future, step back and look at the road behind you.
This will be the first of what I hope become many retrospective posts. I've found retrospectives to be some of the most useful tools we apply
in an engineering capacity, and so I will attempt to apply the same methodology to life, and hope to gain some valuable insights and/or lessons.

<!-- more -->

I haven't really settled for a format, so I'm going to just name some things that went well in 2015 and some goal for 2016 associated with each.

Good things
-----------

### Graduation ###

I graduated this year, yay! My time at Reykjavik University has been incredible. I feel very
lucky to have gotten a chance to get to know so many brilliant teachers and researchers, and the privilege to work with some of them.

*Goal*: Read more papers in 2016. Now that I'm out of university for the time being I want to make sure I still get to learn new things.
While I'm pretty fortunate that my employer emphasizes personal development and learning on the job, I've found the academic environment facilitates
a different kind of learning. I don't allow myself the time investment required to truly understand things when someone else is paying for my time.

### CodeMesh ###

I attended the [CodeMesh](http://www.codemesh.io) conference in London with a coworker. I was absolutely blown away by the diversity and quality of the talks.
This was the first time I attended a conference, but it won't be the last. I don't think I've ever absorbed as much information in two days.

*Goal*: Attend a conference in 2016. I really want to make it out to [Strangeloop](http://www.thestrangeloop.com) next year. The topics and crowd
seem similar to CodeMesh but the event is larger and longer.


### Podcasts ###

I discovered more new podcasts this year, and started listening more frequently. I have been a huge proponent of podcasts for a long time, and
used to listen on my commute or whenever I was out running or biking. I recently discovered that podcasts are a huge benefit when doing work around the
house, cooking and cleaning up and the like. It even sometimes gets to the point that I look for things to do around the house so that I can listen
to a podcast. Two that I've found this year and would recommend are:

* [Cognicast](http://blog.cognitect.com/cognicast/)
* [Software Engineering Daily](http://softwareengineeringdaily.com)

The latter is a bit high-volume, but I just pick out the topics that interest me.

*Goal*: I guess I don't really have a goal here other than to keep giving myself time to listen to podcasts.

### Books ###

I started keeping track of the books I read on [Goodreads](http://www.goodreads.com) around september. You can see the complete list of things I've read
since then [here](https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2015/19002814). Some highlights include:

* [The Martian](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18007564-the-martian)
* [The Emperor of Maladies](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7170627-the-emperor-of-all-maladies)

A lot of people read The Martian, and I had it recommended to me several times. I don't read much fiction but I'm really glad I made an exception in this case
as I thoroughly enjoyed Weir's book. A work of extreme literary significance this is not. It is however a thrilling read, and very well researched.

The Emperor of Maladies is subtitled a biography of cancer. I found the book to be very well written and I enjoyed the historical view of the medical
profession one so rarely sees. There is a lot of information in this book, presented in an exciting way. If you're looking for something non-technical but
still informative, I highly recommend this book.

*Goal*: I want to keep these goals achievable so I'm going to go with:
read at least 20 books in 2016 of which 5 should be on subjects outside the "computer science" umbrella.

### Sports ###

I ran the Reykjavik Marathon relay race with my brother this year (he ran 30 and I did 12km). I did manage to achieve the goal I had set for myself,
but I had more difficulty with it than I expected. This is also my second year of doing crossfit, which I still enjoy very much but I feel I'm progressing
slower than I was in my first year.

*Goal*: In 2016 I'm going to run a 10k in under 43 minutes, A 21k in under 1:50 and I want to add 10kg to my five main lifts.

Things that went poorly
-----------------------

### Focus ###

I feel like since I left school I've had a hard time focusing on any one thing. My efforts have been spent making small steps in every direction at once,
getting nowhere. I'm up to my spleen in unfinished books, and doing an `ls` in my projects folder requires more than one terminal screen.

*Goal*: I have two specific actionables to increase focus. The first is to focus on one new programming language or technology at once. Only when I've
done a small projecect with it and feel I have an understanding of what makes the language unique will I allow myself to move on. The exception here is if
I decide the language is not worth it, in which case I will allow myself to abandon it, but not to feel like I have unfinished business with it.
The second is much the same but for pet projects. I feel these items are specific enough to be goals, as I can track what I have going on at any time.

### Productivity at work ###

Towards the end of the year I've felt my productivity at work slipping. More time is spent conversing with coworkers and less time actually programming.
This is probably related to the focus item above, since I really enjoy my work and don't suffer from a lack of motivation. I think I just need to be
more organized.

*Goal*: To that end, I've decided to try adopting a technique I read about on a blog a while back (that I can't for the life of me find any more).
The gist of it is that on an A4 piece of paper you draw a vertical line, representing the time left in the day. You then draw horizontal lines to
box out blocks of time devoted to a specific task. This model is flexible enough to handle unexpected things one has to deal with, yet rigid enough
to make slacking off really obvious. I'm looking forward to seeing how this goes.

## Tracking ##

As any software developer knows, goals are useless without tracking metrics. I'm going to be keeping track of the reading goals in a spreadsheet and
on [Goodreads](http://www.goodreads.com) and the sports goals on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/1557995) as usual. Tracking focus and
procrastination will be a bit harder, but I'm going to use a combination of [Rescuetime](https://www.rescuetime.com/) and [github](https://github.com),
as well as noting down my subjective feeling in a weekly review.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2015 was a great year. I had a lot of new experiences and I felt I learned a lot. I'm going to try my best to make sure 2016 will be even better.
